Idea 7: Code Update Service

1) Service to keep all code base of multiple projects updated in the local machine.

2) Must support SVN and git at least. 

3) Allow user to specify projects and their SVN location and their local folders. 

4) Provide notifications and allow user to specify schedule and other settings.


Common Features
Each group is expected to implement the following:

1. Make a windows service 

2. Make a Form based on web based GUI. 

3. Use .NET remoting for IPC between the windows service and the GUI. 

4. Use collection classes in a meaningful way. 

5. Use XML and/or JSON for representation of some data 

6. Use log4Net or an equivalent logging library to log errors, warning, information and debug messages.

Deliverables

1. Source code that follows coding standards and proper comments. 

2. A document explaining the design of the application including software architecture, user interface, class
design and database/storage design. 

3. A document illustrating the use of the application – users’ guide. 

4. Proof that bitbucket was used as source control system for the work (www.bitbucket.org)
